## 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
In this frepositorty , we will find a compilation of files that will help us to understand concepts and aplicactions related to sorting algorthims, Big O and help us to answer the next questions:

  -   At least four different sorting algorithms
  -   What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
  -   How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
  -   What is a stable sorting algorithm
## Files
 - 0-bubble_sort.c, 0-O is a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Bubble sort](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/fCItpIfgmE07fFbHBUToeg "Bubble sort") algorithm
 - 1-insertion_sort_list.c, 1-O is a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the [Insertion sort](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/4ueB1I1MkNypoTBXR0YX3g "Insertion sort") algorithm
 - 2-selection_sort.c, 2-O is a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Selection sort](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/_DodgdySm5bPerpQm1LhwQ "Selection sort") algorithm
 - 3-quick_sort.c, 3-O is a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Quick sort](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/VoeZ2Hwp4Q0piTJ3OODY3w "Quick sort") algorithm
